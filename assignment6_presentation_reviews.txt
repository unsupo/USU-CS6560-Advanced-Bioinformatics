Kalyan Bhonagiri
	Insights from Mitochondrial DNA.  	

Santhosh Boggarapu
	Understanding Mitochondrial DNA.
	Nice use of the wiki picture and good explanation of computer science problem.
	Seemed a little rushed however.
	Didnâ€™t have dates.
	Alignment on the proteins not DNA 

Aditya Chandel
	DNA Sequencing, shortest superstring problem
	Good use of introduction and images coupled with explanation.
	explanation of algorithm and dataset

Vinay Chhodavadiya
	DNA Sequencing
	good off-slide explanations
	lots of possible algorithms and good explanation for comparison. 
	try to extend algorithm to modify synthetic data, test and develop at the same time 

Michael Jasper
	Great work, good slides.
		

Lokesh Kodavali
	DNA Sequencing
	good history with explanation 
	a few seemingly wordy slides
	seems very ambitious with repeating sections as open problem, reduce scope
	phage lambda is a nice small problem
	add additional extensions for real data 
	investigate one particular extension or problem

Curtis Larsen
	impressive work

Nivali Madabhushnam
	DNA Sequencing - Shortest superstring
	nice outline
	definitions slide was quick, if at all
	good sudo code included

Aditya Mehra
	Insights from Mitochondrial DNA
	good image for explanation.
	interesting guide tree made by UPGMA (unexplained)
	hidden markov models will be used
	gap penalties in real data with affine gap penalty
	good explanation of tools for comparison.
	tools: coffee.org, clustal.org
	cluster omega

Gopal Menon
	exactly as described, good project

Shobhit Mundra
	DNA Sequencing
	interesting layout of slides hard to read headers
	quite short
