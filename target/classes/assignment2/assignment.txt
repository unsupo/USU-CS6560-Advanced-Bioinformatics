Implement the Partial Digest problem given on page 90 of the book
(attached). First, test the code by running it on some of the examples
in the slides and book to make sure it is working correctly. Then write
an automated testing routine that generates problems (random cut points
X), creates the set of fragments L, then runs the Branch-and-Bound
algorithm on L. For each run, the set of solutions must include the
original set X. Once you have verified that the code is working over
thousands of random problems, now evaluate the efficiency of the
algorithm. Run the algorithm with a set of random problems of increasing
size (the number of cut points, |X|). Start with around 15 cut points so
the algorithm takes long enough to time. Generate a graph where the
x-axis is the number of cut points and the y-axis is LOG of the run
time. Generate a scatter plot where each point is the result of a single
run. What is the estimated complexity of the algorithm (the function
that maps problem size to time)?

Submit your code, your graph, and a brief explanation of its performance.
